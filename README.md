# Efficient Known-Sample Attack for Distance-Preserving Hashing Biometric Template Protection Schemes

JAVA implementation of efficinet known sample attack for distance preserving biometric template protection scheme.
Save the code in your project folder. The code can start directly from Eclipse by running Attack.java. 
The code has been simplified by just taking two raw samples (without additional transformation applied) and output a synthetic samples with minimized distance score.

***Remark**

This paper has also introduced a countermeasure that incorporates transformation and authentication mechanisms. It is crucial to note that the transformation function used for template transformation has been found to be vulnerable under security analysis conducted by Paik, S., Kim, S., & Seo, J. H. (2023) in their work titled "Security Analysis on Locality-Sensitive Hashing-Based Biometric Template Protection Schemes
