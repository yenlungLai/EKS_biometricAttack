# EKS_biometricAttack

JAVA implementation of efficinet known sample attack for distance preserving biometric template protection scheme.
Save the code in your project folder. The code can start directly from Eclipse by running Attack.java. 
The code has been simplified by just taking two raw samples (without additional transformation applied) and output a synthetic samples with minimized distance score.
